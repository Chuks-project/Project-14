## EXPERIENCE CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION WITH JENKINS | ANSIBLE | ARTIFACTORY | SONARQUBE | PHP

Project 14 is a typical example of an End-to-End Implementtion of CI(Continous Integration) and CD(Continuous Delivery and Deployment) process. This project made use of Jenkins, Ansible, Artifactory, Sonarqube and PHP Application.

- Why do we need SonarQube?
SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality, it is used to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.

- Why do we need Artifactory?
Artifactory is a product by JFrog that serves as a binary repository manager. The binary repository is a natural extension to the source code repository, in that the outcome of your build process is stored. It can be used for certain other automation, but we will it strictly to manage our build artifacts.

## SET UP
This project is partly a continuation of your Ansible work which we have seen from Project 11, so simply add and subtract based on the new setup in this project. It will require a lot of servers to simulate all the different environments from dev/ci all the way to production.

To get started, we will focus on these environments initially.
- Ci
- Dev
- Pentest
